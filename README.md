I'm interested in the domain of urban land use/activity & mobility (both macro patterns and the variability between socioeconomic groups) and urban systems, through the means of spatial analysis and network science. Keen to explore new approaches/techniques.

Contact me at xu_yuting@hotmail.com should you have any question.
