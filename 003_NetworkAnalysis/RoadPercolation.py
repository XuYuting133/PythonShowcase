# # Network Percolation
# 
# This is a small exercise to plot street segments of Singapore that are shorter than a certain threshold.
# 
# ## Background
# The idea comes from percolation theroy in statistical physics and has been used applied to study road networks.
# In percolation theory, sites/nodes are considered connected by an edge/link, if the probability of permitting flows is below a certain percolation threshold *p*.
# 
# ## Conceptualisation
# We first construct the road network where *nodes (N)* are street intersections, *edges (E)* are the road segments, and *weights (W)* are the road segment length. Weights are interpreted as cost of traversing respective edges, and hence, a function of probability of permitting flows between nodes.
# 
# By altering the value of p, we observe the changing state of network from a mostly connected state to a fully disconnected state. The results should be further interpreted against principles of network formation.

# We can visually observe that as the percolation threshold decreases, the entire network breaks down from a connected whole to localised clusters. And of course, considerable spatial heterogeneity is observed. Naturally network density varies spatially. Some clusters also persist longer while others quickly breaks down.

# ## Plot Component Size/Number Change with Percolation threshold
# 
# What we have presented above is very crude visual observations of how a network breaks down when we lower the cost threshold of travelling. We now present, how the number of connected components in the network, and the size of the largest component, vary with the range of percolation threshold. For this, we will need libraries e.g. networkx that can efficiently deal with graphs/networks.

# One striking observation is how the size of the largest component quickly drops at a certain "critical" percolation threshold (around 1400m). Subsequently multiple simililar "critical" values are observed.
# The size of the second largest cluster is considerably smaller than the largest component. Only at p=800m then did the second largest cluster becomes approximately larger than half of the largest cluster.
